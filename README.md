## 1. Description
### 1.1 About This Project
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

### 1.2 The Aim of The Project
The aim of this project is to showcase my programming skills by using the Hangman game as an example. 

### 1.3 What I have learnt

## 2. Installation Instructions
1. Clone the GitHub repository. 
## 3. Usage Instructions
When the script is running, the user is asked to guess the letter of the word. The user have 5 tries to guess correctly. 
## 4. File Structure of The Project
- README.md
- Milestone_2.py
- Milestone_3.py

## 5. My Progression Through Each Milestone
- Milestone_2.py
   - This is where I build my foundation on creating the hangman project by creating a list of fruits and ramdomising it while telling the user to enter a letter to see if it will match the chosen fruit by the ramdomiser.
- Milestone_3.py
   - I check to see if the guess is in the word using a while loop and to create it all in a function to run the checks.
